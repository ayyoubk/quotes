# Quotes

## Feature

This App uses the file [recentquotes.json](app/src/main/resources/recentquotes.json) to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## How to Run Application

- If you want to add any dependencies just add it to  [build.gradle](app/build.gradle) file.

-  All dependencies have been added to the application. Just run `./gradlew run` to install proper dependencies.
