# Quotes

## Lab-08 Feature

This App uses the file [recentquotes.json](app/src/main/resources/recentquotes.json) to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## How to Run Application

- If you want to add any dependencies just add it to  [build.gradle](app/build.gradle) file.

-  All dependencies have been added to the application. Just run `./gradlew run` to install proper dependencies.

## Lab-09 Feature Tasks 
When running the application, if you had internet connection the app will make a request to an API to get a random quote.
but if your app has errors in connecting to the Internet, you will see a random quote from our file.
